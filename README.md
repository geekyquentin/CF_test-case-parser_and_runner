---

## Requirements

### VSCode

[Install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### CMake

[Install Chocolatey](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup)

[Install CMake](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/cmake)

Add path to Environment Variables

-   Right-click on **This PC**, go to **Properties > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables**
-   Click on the **Path** column in **System variables** and click **Edit**
-   Click **New**, paste `C:\Program Files\CMake\bin`, and click **OK**
-   Finally, close and reopen VSCode

### Compiler: **MinGW**

In VSCode, go to **File > Preferences > Settings**

Search for **C_Cpp â€º Default: Compiler Path** and set it to `C:/MinGW/bin/g++.exe`

## Overview

This repository contains the following files:

**[.clang-format]**: C++ code formatter that provides an option that lets the user define their custom code style options

**[CMakeLists.txt]**: directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets.

**[fetch_cases.py]**: takes **contest number** and **problem letter** as input to access the specific problem with the URL (for example, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1681/A) to parse all the test cases with its inputs and outputs into their respective text files

**[run.py]**: executes the code with the input generated by [fetch_cases.py] for all test cases

**[remove_exe.py]**: removes the executable of the program from [CMakeLists.txt]

**[make.bat]**: contains lines with commands executing in sequence. Performs multiple tasks as per the user's request, all of which are discussed in the next section

## How to use

Clone this repository and open it in VSCode. To clone, run

`git clone https://github.com/geekyquentin/cf_test-case-parser_and_runner`

[CMakeLists.txt] might be having some executables added, and it throws errors when it doesn't find its corresponding source files. To remove the added executables from the list, run

`./make.bat rex`

Open a problem in the [codeforces site](codeforces.com). From its URL, get the **contest number** and the **problem letter** (for example, in https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1681/A, **contest_number** is **1681** and **problem_letter** is **A**).

### Get test cases

To get the input and output for all test cases, run

`./make.bat contest_number problem_letter gtc`

**Function:** [fetch_cases.py] accesses the page and parses the test cases. [make.bat] creates `problem_letter.cpp` in the directory `contest_number`, adds an executable of this program to [CMakeLists.txt], and opens it in VSCode.

### Run the program

To run the program on every test case, run

`./make.bat contest_number problem_letter debug`

**Function:** [make.bat] generates the CMake build directory if it doesn't exist and builds all the executables that are added to the [CMakeLists.txt]. [run.py] runs the executable in CMake build directory for all test cases and writes the output to **code_output.txt**.

To compare the outputs, use `run` instead of `debug`

`./make.bat contest_number problem_letter run`

### Add to TODO list

To add a problem to the TODO list, run

`./make.bat contest_number problem_letter todo`

### Clean files

To perform a clean-up, run

`./make.bat clean`

**Function:** Deletes input and output files generated while parsing test cases and removes the CMake build directory

## Other points to note

If the problem doesn't ask for the number of test cases as an input, edit the `main()` function accordingly

To disable [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) for the **.cpp** files, add `"github.copilot.enable": { "cpp": false, }` to **.vscode/settings.json**
