## Overview

This repository contains the following files:

-   **[.clang-format](https://github.com/geekyquentin/cf_test-case-parser_and_runner/blob/master/.clang-format)**: C++ code formatter that provides an option that lets the user define their custom code style options
-   **[CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/geekyquentin/cf_test-case-parser_and_runner/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt)**: directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets.
-   **[getTestCases.py](https://github.com/geekyquentin/cf_test-case-parser_and_runner/blob/master/getTestCases.py)**: takes **contest number** and **problem letter** as input to access the specific problem with the URL (for example, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1681/A) to parse all the test cases with its inputs and outputs into their respective text files
-   **[runner.py](https://github.com/geekyquentin/cf_test-case-parser_and_runner/blob/master/runner.py)**: executes the code with the input generated by [getTestCases.py](https://github.com/geekyquentin/cf_test-case-parser_and_runner/blob/master/getTestCases.py) for all test cases
-   **[make.bat](https://github.com/geekyquentin/cf_test-case-parser_and_runner/blob/master/make.bat)**: contains lines with commands executing in sequence. Performs multiple tasks as per the user's request, all of which are discussed in the next section

## How to use

Clone this repository and open it in VSCode. To clone, run

`git clone https://github.com/geekyquentin/cf_test-case-parser_and_runner`

[CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/geekyquentin/cf_test-case-parser_and_runner/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) might be having some executables added, and it throws errors when it doesn't find its corresponding source files. To remove the added executables from the list, run

`./make.bat setup`

Open a problem in the [codeforces site](codeforces.com). From its URL, get the **contest number** and the **problem letter** (for example, in https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1681/A, **contest_number** is **1681** and **problem_letter** is **A**).

### Get test cases

To get the input and output for every test case, run

`./make.bat contest_number problem_letter gtc`

**Function:** [getTestCases.py](https://github.com/geekyquentin/cf_test-case-parser_and_runner/blob/master/getTestCases.py) accesses the page and parses the test cases. [make.bat](https://github.com/geekyquentin/cf_test-case-parser_and_runner/blob/master/make.bat) creates `problem_letter.cpp` in the directory `contest_number`, adds an executable of this program to [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/geekyquentin/cf_test-case-parser_and_runner/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt), and opens it in VSCode.

### Run the program

To run the program on every test case, run

`./make.bat contest_number problem_letter debug`

**Function:** [make.bat](https://github.com/geekyquentin/cf_test-case-parser_and_runner/blob/master/make.bat) generates the CMake build directory if it doesn't exist and builds all the executables that are added to the [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/geekyquentin/cf_test-case-parser_and_runner/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt). [runner.py](https://github.com/geekyquentin/cf_test-case-parser_and_runner/blob/master/runner.py) runs the executable in CMake build directory for every test case and writes the output to **code_output.txt**.

To compare the outputs, use `run` instead of `debug`

`./make.bat contest_number problem_letter run`

### Clean files

To perform a clean-up, run

`./make.bat clean`

**Function:** Deletes input and output files generated while parsing test cases and removes the CMake build directory

## Other points to note

If the problem doesn't ask for the number of test cases as an input, edit the `main()` function accordingly
